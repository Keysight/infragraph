# Infraph (INFrastructure gRAPH)

Infrastructure as a graph defines a [model-driven, vendor-neutral, standard
interface](https://keysight.github.io/infraph/openapi.html) for capturing a system of systems suitable for use in co-designing AI/HPC solutions.

This model allows for defining physical infrastructure with a logical view using graph like terminology.
In addition to the logical graph definition, an unlimited number of different physical characteristics
can be associated with logical endpoints.
