# InfraGraph (INFRAstructure GRAPH)

InfraGraph or infrastructure graph defines a [model-driven, vendor-neutral, standard
interface](https://keysight.github.io/infragraph/openapi.html) for capturing a system of systems suitable for use in co-designing AI/HPC solutions.

This model allows for defining physical infrastructure using graph like terminology.
Using the base graph definition, an unlimited number of different physical and/or logical characteristics/views
can be associated with the graph.
