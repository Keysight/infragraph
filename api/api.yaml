        Given an infrastructure object this API method will create a fully qualified infrastructure graph and validate it.


        Creating a fully qualified infrastructure graph requires the following steps:
          - process each of the infrastructure instance objects by locating the device and creating a subgraph using the device's edges and substituting the instance name for the device name.
          - process each of the infrastructure edges, looking up the instance to determine the max count and the name to be substituted for the device and link the subgraphs to create a complete infrastructure graph
