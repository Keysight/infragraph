  title: Infrastructure as a Graph
  description: |-
    ### Overview
    Infrastructure as a Graph defines a model-driven, vendor-neutral, standard
    interface for capturing a system of systems suitable for use in co-designing AI/HPC solutions.

    This model allows for defining physical infrastructure as a logical system of systems using graph like terminology.
    In addition to defining a logical graph, an unlimited number of different physical characteristics
    can be associated with logical endpoints.

    ### Graph Terminology
    - `vertex` is the fundamental unit or entity within a graph; represented as a point. In this model it is one of the following:
      - a combination of a component name and a 0 based index such as `asic.0`
      - a device instance name, a 0 based index, an external component and a 0 based index such as `host.0.nic.0`.
    - `edge` is a connection between two vertices in a graph. It can be a connection between two component instances or two device instances. The connection also includes a logical label for identifying the type of link between the two vertexes, for example `asic.0`.`ic`.`port.0`
    - `path` is a sequence of connections that allows for traversal through the graph

            Connections define the graph with each connection consisting of the following criteria in a string separated by dots:
            - `Device.Instance.property.name` e.g., host
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Device.Instance.property.count` e.g., 0
            - `Component.property.name` where `Component.property.external` is true e.g., nic
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Component.property.count` e.g., 0
            - `Infrastructure.properties.links.property.name`
            - `Device.Instance.property.name` e.g., leafsw
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Device.Instance.property.count` e.g., 0
            - `Component.property.name` where `Component.property.external` is true e.g., port
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Component.property.count` e.g., 0

            The example pieces are concatenated using a dot notation and would form the following connection string `host.0.nic.0.eth.leafsw.0.port.0`.

    Device:
      description: |-
        A subgraph container for a device and its components, links and connections.
        The connections form a subgraph.

        e.g., Describe a switch device in detail.

        At a simple level a switch has an asic and ports.
        The asic can be made up of of core, mem, crypt, alu, dsp, pll, ics (interconnect structure), iop (i/o pad).
        The Device can capture just the asic and ports connected by an integrated circuit or
        the asic can be broken down into more discrete components.

        Simple Approach: asic, cpu, port, ic
        Detailed Approach: cpu, core, mem, alu, pll, iop, ic, port

          The Arista is a network switch platform,

          typically implemented using a Jericho2 ASIC
        components: [core, mem, crypt, alu, iop, port]
