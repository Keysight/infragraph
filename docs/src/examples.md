These examples demonstrate `describing` a variety of devices and infrastructures using text descriptions and diagrams to `defining` them using a `standardized schema`.

## DGX-A100 Server
This server diagram acts as an example of how multiple components can be connected to a single component such as multiple gpu components are connected to a single pcie switch.

The graph model is able to capture the asymmetric layout of the device.
