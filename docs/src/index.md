Modern AI systems, comprising diverse scale-up and scale-out interconnect topologies that integrate complex heterogeneous components, connected together via diverse means, face a lack of standardized overall infrastructure description, all which hinders benchmarking, simulation, and emulation.

This documentation covers the following:

### Backgroun
The [background](background.md) and justification behind the schema

### Getting Started
A simple generic case study demonstrating how to [get started](create.md)

### Extending the case study with additional data
This section provides a comprehensive guide on how a user can annotate various parts of infrastructre and add more details like DeviceType, Rank Identifier and so on. It covers the model description with examples for binding physical attributes with the logical infrastructure definition.

### Services
The site provides services for `validating` concrete instances of schemas.

### Advanced Examples
Advanced [examples](examples.md) include complex servers, hierarchical devices, and scaleup/scaleout infrastructure.

### Specification Browser
The API and Models can easily be reviewed using the auto-generated OpenAPI model and redocly html documentation.

### Community
