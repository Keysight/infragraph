Modern AI systems, comprising diverse scale-up and scale-out interconnect topologies that integrate complex heterogeneous components, connected together via diverse means, face a lack of standardized overall infrastructure description, all which hinders benchmarking, simulation, and emulation.

This documentation covers the following:
* The [background](background.md) and justification behind the schema
* A simple generic case study demonstrating how to [get started](create.md)
* extending the case study with additional data
    * This section provides a comprehensive guide on how a user can annotate various parts of infrastructre and add more details like DeviceType, Rank Identifier and so on. It covers the model description with examples for binding physical attributes with the logical infrastructure definition.
* validation
* advanced [examples](examples.md)
* API and Model specification browser
* Use our community resources to get help with [Infrastructure As A Graph](https://github.com/Keysight/graphit) on Github
