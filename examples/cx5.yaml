            The network ports on the ConnectX-5 card connect externally to Ethernet switches
            or other network devices.
            These ports use SFP28 or QSFP28 transceivers and support various speeds
            (10/25/40/50/100 Gb/s Ethernet).

            The PCIe interface facilitates direct communication of data and control signals
             between the ConnectX-5 card and the server's CPU and system memory.
             This includes peer-to-peer communications such as NVIDIA PeerDirect,
             which enables efficient RDMA access by eliminating unnecessary internal data copies,
             for example between GPUs and CPUs.
      connections:
        - asic.0.pcie.port.0
        - asic.0.pcie.port.1
