            Type of component.

            - `custom` If the type of a component is not listed as an enum it can be defined using the custom type.
            - `device` This enum allows a device to be composed of other devices. When this enum is selected the name of the component MUST be the name of a device that exists in the Infrastructure.devices array.
            - `cpu` A high level definition for a cpu
            - `npu` A high level definition for a neural processing unit
            - `nic` A high level definition for a network interface card, for more detailed breakdowns create a device representing a specific type network interface card
            - `memory` A high level definition for memory
            - `port` A high level definitiion for an IO port.
