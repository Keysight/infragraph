      description: |-
        A subgraph container for a device and its components, links and connections.
        The connections form a subgraph.

        e.g., Describe a switch device in detail.

        At a simple level a switch has an asic and ports.
        The asic can be made up of of core, mem, crypt, alu, dsp, pll, ics (interconnect structure), iop (i/o pad).
        The Device can capture just the asic and ports connected by an integrated circuit or
        the asic can be broken down into more discrete components.

        Simple Approach: asic, cpu, port, ic
        Detailed Approach: cpu, core, mem, alu, pll, iop, ic, port

        name: arista
        description: |-
          The Arista is a network switch platform,
          commonly equipped with 48 x 1G Ethernet ports and 4 x 10G uplink ports,
          typically implemented using a Jericho2 ASIC
        components: [core, mem, crypt, alu, iop, port]
        links: [ics]
        connections:
            - core.0.ics.mem.0
            - core.0.ics.crypt.0
            - core.0.ics.alu.0
            - core.0.ics.iop.0
            - core.0.ics.iop.47
            - iop.0.ics.port.0
            ...
            - iop.47.ics.port.47

        - to traverse from the core asic to a port, multiple connections are used to form a path
          - core.0.ics.iop.0.ics.port.0

          description: |-
            An array of edges that are used to produce a device graph.
            These are used to connect components to each other or components
            to other device components (composability).
            The generated graph edges will be fully qualified using the count property
            of the device and component and slice notation of each endpoint in the edge object.
