    Device:
      description: |-
        A subgraph container for a device and its components, links and edges.
        The edges form a subgraph of the device.
      type: object
      required:
        - name
        - components
        - links
        - edges
      properties:
        name:
          description: |-
            The name of the device being described.

          x-field-uid: 1
        description:
          description: |-
            A description of the device.
            This will not be used in Infrastructure.connections.
          type: string
          x-field-uid: 2
        components:
          type: array

          x-field-uid: 3
        links:
          description: |-
            All the links that make up this device.
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "./link.yaml#/components/schemas/Link"
          x-field-uid: 4
        edges:
          description: |-
            An array of edges that are used to produce a device graph.
            These are used to connect components to each other or components
            to other device components (composability).
            The generated graph edges will be fully qualified using the count property
            of the device and component and slice notation of each endpoint in the edge object.
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "./edge.yaml#/components/schemas/Device.Edge"
          x-field-uid: 5
