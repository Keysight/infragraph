    Device:
      description: |-
        A subgraph container for a device and its components, links and connections.
        The connections form a subgraph.

        e.g., Describe a switch device in detail.

        At a simple level a switch has an asic and ports.
        The asic can be made up of of core, mem, crypt, alu, dsp, pll, ics (interconnect structure), iop (i/o pad).
        The Device can capture just the asic and ports connected by an integrated circuit or
        the asic can be broken down into more discrete components.

        Simple Approach: asic, cpu, port, ic
        Detailed Approach: cpu, core, mem, alu, pll, iop, ic, port

        name: arista
        description: |-
          The Arista is a network switch platform,
          commonly equipped with 48 x 1G Ethernet ports and 4 x 10G uplink ports,
          typically implemented using a Jericho2 ASIC
        components: [core, mem, crypt, alu, iop, port]
        links: [ics]
        connections:
            - core.0.ics.mem.0
            - core.0.ics.crypt.0
            - core.0.ics.alu.0

            - core.0.ics.iop.47
            - iop.0.ics.port.0
            ...
            - iop.47.ics.port.47

        - to traverse from the core asic to a port, multiple connections are used to form a path
          - core.0.ics.iop.0.ics.port.0

            Connections are of the form `Component.name.index`.`Link.name`.`Component.name.index`
            The `index` in the connection string is 0 based and must be >=0 and < Component.count.

            This allows components to be connected to whatever depth is needed.
