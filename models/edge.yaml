        - component
      properties:
        device:
          description: |-
            An optional name of a device that contains the component.
            If the property is empty the name of the device is the parent of the edge object.
            An endpoint will be generated for every device based on the count.

        component:
          description: |-
            The name of a component that exists in the containing device
            and the indexes of the component.

            The indexes MUST be specified using python slice notation.

            example: cx5[0:2]
          type: string
          pattern: (.+?)\[(\d*):(\d*):?(\d*)\]

            The name of a device that contains the component and MUST exist
            in the infrastructure devices.

            The indexes MUST be specified using python slice notation.

            example: cx5[0:2]

            The name of a component that MUST exist in the device specified in this endpoint.

            The indexes MUST be specified using python slice notation.

            example: cx5[0:2]

            If `true` every endpoint from ep1 will form an edge with every endpoint from ep2.

            If `false` endpoints generated from ep1 and ep2 should be of the same length and
            will be assigned together in the order they appear in each list.
