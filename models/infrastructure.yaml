        connections:
          description: |-
            Connections define the graph with each connection consisting of the following criteria in a string separated by dots:
            - `Device.Instance.property.name` e.g., host
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Device.Instance.property.count` e.g., 0
            - `Component.property.name` where `Component.property.external` is true e.g., nic
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Component.property.count` e.g., 0
            - `Infrastructure.properties.links.property.name`
            - `Device.Instance.property.name` e.g., leafsw
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Device.Instance.property.count` e.g., 0
            - `Component.property.name` where `Component.property.external` is true e.g., port
            - a 0 based index that is less than `Component.property.count` e.g., 0

            The example pieces are concatenated using a dot notation and would form the following connection string `host.0.nic.0.eth.leafsw.0.port.0`.

        annotations:
          description: |-
            Annotations are meant to be used to correlate static and/or dynamic information
            (e.g., configuration, routing etc) that is not covered by the schema to logical endpoints.

            Examples:
            - host.0.nic.0 can be associated with detailed nic configuration attributes that are outside of the scope of this schema.
