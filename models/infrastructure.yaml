        annotations:

            Annotations allows for extending the base configuration with any type of
            additional information such as logical layouts, physical configuration etc.

            This feature is essential for APIs that need to support flexible or
            evolving data structures without requiring schema changes for
            every additional property.

            This allows an organization to add their own data structures or
            open source data such as openconfig configuration messages which can be
            correlated to specific configuration endpoints.

            $ref: "./annotation.yaml#/components/schemas/Annotation"
