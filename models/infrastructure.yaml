            Connections define the infrastructure graph with each connection consisting
            of exactly 5 names and 4 indexes.

            Example:
            - server.0.nic.0.eth1.leafsw.0.port.0
              - the name `server` exists in the Infrastructure.instances array in the device property
              - the index `0` indicates there is at least 1 instance of the `server` device
              - the name `nic` is the name of an external component in the `server` device
              - the index `0` indicates there is at least 1 instance of the `nic` component
